# GoRecord

This is meant to be a Go ORM similar to ActiveRecord.  
There are a million Go ORMs, but none of them quite as good as ActiveRecord.
`sqlboiler` comes close ( https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler ), but
I don't like the reliance on config files.  Looking for a more Go-ish solution.

This is a brand new project, so don't expect full magic.
